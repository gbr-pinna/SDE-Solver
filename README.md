# SDE-Solver

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a solver for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) using the Euler-Maruyama scheme. The Euler-Maruyama method is a simple and widely used numerical method for solving SDEs, especially when dealing with stochastic processes.

The notebook demonstrates how to:
1) Define and solve SDEs.
2) Visualize sample paths of the solution.
3) Estimate the mean and covariance of the process at different times.
